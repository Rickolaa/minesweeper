# Minesweeper

A simple Minesweeper game developed in C# using WPF/XAML, built with Visual Studio 2022.

## Description

This project is a basic graphical version of the classic Minesweeper game, made with .NET and the WPF framework.  
The interface uses only default buttons and simple text or emoji for graphicsâ€”no custom images are used for the visuals.

## Features

- Very simple and minimalistic graphics (default buttons and emoji/text only)
- Customizable grid size and number of mines
- Win/loss detection
- Game reset functionality

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10 or later
- Visual Studio 2022

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rickolaa/minesweeper.git
   ```
2. Open the project folder in Visual Studio 2022 by double-clicking on the `.sln` file.

## Usage

- Start the game from Visual Studio (`F5` or "Start" button).
- Play using the default interface:
  - Click tiles to reveal them.
  - Right-click to flag potential mines (if implemented).
  - Win by revealing all safe tiles!

## Notes

- The game uses only basic graphics (no images), so the appearance is very simple and functional.
